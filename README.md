## The p-Center Problem

Authors : Erica Berghman & Charles Hamesse

Implementation in Julia language combined with the JuMP package of two formulations of the p-Center Problem:

- The formulation proposed by Daskin (1995).
- The formulation proposed by Calik and Tansel (2013).

These formulations can be found in [1], pages 2992 and 2993 respectively.
